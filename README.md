# PaperStack

PaperStack is a component container whose subcomponents are presented sequentially, one subcomponent at a time. User can switch between the subcomponents by mouse dragging the upper right corner of a view revealing the underlying subcomponent simultaneously. The transition effect simulates leafing through a stack of papers.
